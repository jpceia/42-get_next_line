I have to write a program that reads numbers in separate lines each.
Is it possible to read only one line of the file and then read an int from the buffer,
and so on until the end of file? It is really hard to find good examples of using read and write.

My example is kind of working but I'd like to read until it detects
'\n' char and then convert buffer into int
